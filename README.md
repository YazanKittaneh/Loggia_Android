Chatter* looks to make an impact in inner college relations. It tackles both a problem for students, and for party** makers. It is what it wants to be: a word of mouth app. It is a tool to use to both spread a party, but also make the party appealing. It needs to be simple and efficient in spreading the event. 

# Goals:
* For the user
* Easily invite your friends to parties events you are interested in
* Easily BE invited to events
* Be enticed to go to events

# For the maker
* Easily create an event with all relevant information, cutting out the excessive  back and forth
* Make an event enticing to go
* Spread word of the event in a quick manner

# Student end:
As a user, I want to get events that my friends are going to. I want to easily invite my friends to things I am doing. I want to ask my friends what they are up to, and be able to find out. 
# How it works
You get notifications of an invitation. It says “So and So invited you to This and That”. Its something you are actually interested in, and since So and So invited you, you’ll probably find them there! You also want to invite your bestfriend, so you forward the invitation to tem. 

You have nothing planned for the weekend. You just want to know if there is a party going on. You ping your two closest party friends. One of them sends back a high street party. 

You are getting ready for a saturday night. You get a ping by a friend. You get the options to say that you have nothing or send them an invite. “Well this guy is cool” so you send them the invite to the high street party.

# Maker end
As a party maker, I want to get my party spread. I want control over how many people in total there can be, as well as have certain restrictions on who can/can’t be invited. I don’t want too many questions about the party since it will already be there. 
# How it works
I want to get a house party going. I personally can only invite about 10 people comfortably. I send an invite to those people. I quickly see each of those 10 people invite 3-5 people themselves. All of a sudden, I have a party of 40 people. All of a sudden those people invite their friends. and you have 100 people invited to your party.

I want to have something huge going on on cleave beach. I invite 30 friends. They invite their friends. The chain continues until there's about 300 people invited. People look at the invite list and see a 300 people count and keep spreading. 10/10 size party then ensues. 

I want to throw a small get together. I set a certain number restriction. I send the invitation out. People are selective about who they invite. Its pretty chill. 



*Chatter is a prototype name. It is subjected to change
**Party and event will be switched a lot. At this point, they are interchangeable.
